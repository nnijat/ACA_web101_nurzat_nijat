        <h3>Title 1</h3>
        He ran into a major challenge right off the bat. After visiting a number
        of aerospace manufacturers around the world, Musk discovered the cost of
        purchasing a rocket was astronomical—up to $65 million. Given the high
        price, he began to rethink the problem.

        <h3>Title 2</h3>
        Instead of buying a finished rocket for tens of millions, Musk decided
        to create his own company, purchase the raw materials for cheap, and
        build the rockets himself. SpaceX was born.

        <h3>Title 3</h3>
        Within a few years, SpaceX had cut the price of launching a rocket by
        nearly 10x while still making a profit. Musk used first principles
        thinking to break the situation down to the fundamentals, bypass the
        high prices of the aerospace industry, and create a more effective
        solution.

        <h3>Title 4</h3>
        In theory, first principles thinking requires you to dig deeper and
        deeper until you are left with only the foundational truths of a
        situation. Rene Descartes, the French philosopher and scientist,
        embraced this approach with a method now called Cartesian Doubt in which
        he would “systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until
        he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths.”

        <h3>Title 5</h3>
        What can you create from these individual parts? One option is to make a
        snowmobile by combining the handlebars and seat from the bike, the metal
        treads from the tank, and the motor and skis from the boat.
